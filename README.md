# [quarto](https://quarto.org/) sources for ["Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R and Python"](https://r-spatial.org/python)

The print version of this book is available from [CRC/Chapman and Hall](https://www.routledge.com/Spatial-Data-Science-With-Applications-in-R/Pebesma-Bivand/p/book/9781138311183). A complete online version of this book [is available](https://r-spatial.org/book).

To recreate/reproduce this book:

* git clone this repository
* download the [data used in Ch 13](https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/8mEbeHPOX9GdAYn), and extract the contents of the `aq` subdirectory into `sdsr/aq`
* install R package dependencies [listed below](#dependencies)
* install [quarto](https://quarto.org/) 
* run `quarto render --to html`

See also the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/edzer/sdsr/tree/main/docker); building the (18 Gb) image with
```
docker build . -t sdsr
```
and running it with
```
docker run -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true -ti --rm sdsr
```
will serve an Rstudio server instance on <http://localhost:8787/>, without authentication.


## Compiling the whole book

After running the docker image and opening `rstudio` in the browser:

* click on `01-hello.qmd` in the bottom-right pane
* click on the `Render` button of the top-left pane to compile the whole book

this should open a new browser window with the full book rendered (you may need to switch off popup blockers for localhost)

## Running selected chunks 

To run a selected code section, possibly after modification, find the selected code section in the corresponding `.qmd` file, and click the small green arrow symbols on the top-right corner of the code blocks:

* to prepare, first click `Run All Chunks Above`,
* to run a selected code chunk: click `Run Current Chunk`

```
or as binary from `r-universe`:
```
options(repos = c(
  rspatial = "https://r-spatial.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages(c("spatialreg"))
```

## Daily rendered version on GA

The entire book is recreated from source nightly with the latest released R and all updated [CRAN]() packages by a [Github Action](https://github.com/edzer/sdsr/actions) using this [script](https://github.com/edzer/sdsr/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml). The online version thus rendered is found [here](https://edzer.github.io/sdsr/). As this output is not checked daily it is not automatically copied to the "official" online version, at https://r-spatial.org/book/ .

## Python version

The version with subtitle "With Applications in R and Python" is under construction; the sources are in the python branch of this repository, a rendered online version is found at https://r-spatial.org/python/ .
