abstract="Functions to calculate measures of spatial association, especially measures of spatial autocorrelation, have been made available in many software applications. Measures may be global, applying to the whole data set under consideration, or local, applying to each observation in the data set. Methods of statistical inference may also be provided, but these will, like the measures themselves, depend on the support of the observations, chosen assumptions, and the way in which spatial association is represented; spatial weights are often used as a representational technique. In addition, assumptions may be made about the underlying mean model, and about error distributions. Different software implementations may choose to expose these choices to the analyst, but the sets of choices available may vary between these implementations, as may default settings. This comparison will consider the implementations of global Moran's I, Getis--Ord G and Geary's C, local {\$}{\$}I{\_}i{\$}{\$}Iiand {\$}{\$}G{\_}i{\$}{\$}Gi, available in a range of software including Crimestat, GeoDa, ArcGIS, PySAL and R contributed packages.",

abstract = {We propose a new estimator of spatial autocorrelation of areal incidence or prevalence rates in small areas, such as crime and health indicators, for correcting spatially heterogeneous sampling errors in denominator data. The approach is dubbed the heteroscedasticity-consistent empirical Bayes (HC-EB) method. As American Community Survey (ACS) data have been released to the public for small census geographies, small-area estimates now form the demographic landscape of neighborhoods. Meanwhile, there is growing awareness of the diminished statistical validity of global and local Moran’s I when such small-area estimates are used in denominator data. Using teen birth rates by census tracts in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, we present comparisons of conventional and new HC-EB estimates of Global and Local Moran’s I statistics created on ACS data, along with estimates on ground truth values from the 2010 decennial census. Results show that the new adjustment method dramatically enhances the statistical validity of global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics.},

abstract = {This article shows that, for both spatial lag and spatial error models with strongly connected weight matrices, maximum likelihood estimates of the spatial dependence parameter are necessarily biased downward. In addition, this bias is shown to be present in general Moran tests of spatial dependency. Thus, positive dependencies may often fail to be detected when weight matrices are strongly connected. The analysis begins with a detailed examination of downward bias for the extreme case of maximally connected weight matrices. Results for this case are then extended by continuity to a broader range of (appropriately defined) strongly connected matrices. Finally, a simulated numerical example is presented to illustrate some of the practical consequences of these biases.},

   reorganizing the sum-of-squared errors function to avoid unnecessary

   large CARs become possible. As an illustration of the power of these
   approaches, a simulation of 250 CARs of 2,905 observations can take
   fewer than three minutes on a personal computer, despite the necessity
   of evaluating 100 determinants of 2,905 by 2,905 matrices. The
   computation of each estimate via examining the profile likelihood
   sampled at 100 points avoids problems of local optima. Simulating
   estimates avoids other problems associated with the traditional
   information matrix approach to inference.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial estimators usually require the manipulation of n(2) relations
   among n observations and use operations such as determinants,
   eigenvalues, and inverses whose operation counts grow at a rate
   proportional to n(3). This paper provides ways to quickly compute
   estimates when the dependent variable follows a spatial autoregressive
   process, which by appropriate specification of the independent
   variables can subsume the case when the errors follow a spatial
   autoregressive process. Since only nearby observations fend to affect a
   given observation, most observations have no effect and hence the
   spatial weight matrix becomes sparse. By exploiting sparsity and
   rearranging computations, one can compute estimates at low cost. As a
   demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques, the paper provides a
   Monte Carlo study whereby 3,107 observation regressions require only
   0.1 seconds each when using Matlab on a 200 Mhz Pentium Pro personal
   computer. In addition, the paper illustrates these techniques by
   examining voting behavior across U.S. counties in the 1980 presidential
   election.}},

abstract = "Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of simultaneous autocorrelation models is well known. Under the presence of missing data, estimation is not straightforward, due to the implied dependence of all units. The EM algorithm is the standard approach to accomplish ML estimation in this case. An alternative approach is considered, the method of maximising the marginal likelihood. At first glance the method is computationally complex due to inversion of large matrices that are of the same size as the complete data, but these can be avoided, leading to an algorithm that is usually much faster than the EM algorithm and without typical EM convergence issues. Another approximate method is also proposed that serves as an alternative, for example when the contiguity matrix is dense. The methods are illustrated using a well known data set on house prices with 25,357 units."

The proposed estimator relies on the approximation of the likelihood function, that follows a multivariate normal distribution which parameters depend on the spatial structure of the observations. The approximation is inspired by the univariate conditioning procedure proposed by Mendell and Elston, with some modifications to improve accuracy and speed. Very accurate parameter estimations have been achieved in reasonable time for simulated data samples with as much as one million observations. The lessons learned in the Monte Carlo experiment have been applied to a case study on urban sprawl over more than forty thousands plots in Southern France."

To complement this situation, spatial scientists need good approximations of eigenvalues for irregular tessellations. Starting from known or approximated extreme eigenvalues, the remaining eigenvalues may be in turn approximated. One reason spatial scientists are interested in eigenvalues is because they are needed to calculate the Jacobian term in the autonormal probability model. If eigenvalues are not needed for model fitting, good approximations are needed to give the interval within which the spatial parameter will lie."

ABSTRACT = {The software for spatial econometrics available in the {R} system for statistical computing is reviewed. The methods are illustrated in a historical perspective, highlighting the main lines of development and employing historically relevant datasets in the examples. Estimators and tests for spatial cross-sectional and panel models based either on maximum likelihood or on generalized moments methods are presented. The paper is concluded reviewing some current active lines of research in spatial econometric software methods.},

abstract="This chapter is concerned with lattice data that have a temporal label as well as a spatial label, where these spatio-temporal data appear in the ``space-time cube'' as a time series of spatial lattice (regular or irregular) processes. The spatio-temporal autoregressive (STAR) models have traditionally been used to model such data but, importantly, one should include a component of variation that models instantaneous spatial dependence as well. That is, the STAR model should include the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model as a subcomponent, for which we give a generic form. Perhaps more importantly, we illustrate how noisy and missing data can be accounted for by using the STAR-like models as process models, alongside a data model and potentially a parameter model, in a hierarchical statistical model (HM).",

abstract="This chapter provides an overview of the literature on econometric land use models including spatial autocorrelation. These models are useful to analyze the determinants of land use changes and to study their implications for the environment (carbon stocks, water quality, biodiversity, ecosystem services). Recent methodological advances in spatial econometrics have improved the quality of econometric models allowing them to identify more precisely the determinants of land use changes and make more accurate land use predictions. We review the current state of the literature on studies which account explicitly for spatial autocorrelation in econometric land use models or in the environmental impacts of land use.",
