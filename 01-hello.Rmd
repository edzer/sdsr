# (PART) Spatial Data {-}

# Getting Started {#intro}
 
This chapter introduces a number of concepts associated with
handling spatial data, and points forward to later sections where
they are discussed in more detail.  The code sections in this chapter
should be easy to follow when understanding R at the level of, say,
[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@r4ds].

## A first map

The typical way to graph spatial data is by creating a map. Let us consider
a simple map:

```{r first-map, fig.cap="a first map", eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() -> nc
nc.32119 <- st_transform(nc, 32119)
nc.32119 %>%
	select(BIR74) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() -> nc
nc.32119 <- st_transform(nc, 32119)
nc.32119 %>%
	select(BIR74) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```
</details>

A number of graphical elements are present, in this case:

* polygons are drawn, and colored according to a variable `BIR74`, whose name is in the title
* a legend key explains the meaning of the colors, and has a certain _color palette_ and _color
breaks_, values at which color changes
* the background of the map shows curved lines with constant latitude or longitude (graticules)
* the axis ticks show the latitude and longitude values 

_Polygons_ are a particular form of _geometry_; spatial geometries
(points, lines, polygons, pixels) are discussed in detail in
chapter \@ref(geometries). Polygons consist of sequences of points,
connected by straight lines. How point locations of spatial data are
expressed, or measured, is discussed in chapter \@ref(cs). As can
be seen from figure \@ref(fig:first-map), lines of equal latitude
and longitude do not form straight lines, indicating that some
form of projection took place before plotting; projections are also
discussed in chapter \@ref(cs) and section \@ref(transform). 

The color values in figure \@ref(fig:first-map) are derived
from numeric values of a variable, `BIR74`, which has a
single value assocated with each geometry or _feature_. Chapter
\@ref(featureattributes) discusses such feature attributes, and the
way they can relate to feature geometries. In this case, `BIR74`
refers to birth counts, meaning counts _over the region_. This
implies that the count does not refer to a value associated with
every point inside the polygon, which the continuous color might
suggest, but rather measures an integral (sum) over the polygon.

Before plotting figure \@ref(fig:first-map) we had to read the data,
in this case from a file (section \@ref(reading)). Printing a data
summary for the first three records of three attribute variables
shows:

```{r first_ten, echo=FALSE}
nc %>% select(AREA, BIR74, SID74) %>% print(n = 3)
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
nc %>% select(AREA, BIR74, SID74) %>% print(n = 3)
```
</details>

The printed output shows 

* the (selected) dataset has 100 features (records) and 3 fields (attributes)
* the geometry type is `MULTIPOLYGON` (chapter \@ref(geometries))
* it has dimension `XY`, indicating that each point will consist of 2 coordinate values
* the range of x and y values of the geometry
* the coordinate reference system is geographic, indicating that coordinates are degrees longitude and latitude, with reference to the `NAD27` datum (chapter \@ref(rs))
* the three selected attribute variables are followed by a variable `geom` of type `MULTIPOLYGON` with unit degrees that contains the polygon information

More complicated plots can involve facet plots with a map in each
facet, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:firstgather).

```{r firstgather,fig.cap="ggplot with facet maps", echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
year_labels = c("SID74" = "1974 - 1978", "SID79" = "1979 - 1984")
nc.32119 %>% select(SID74, SID79) %>% gather(VAR, SID, -geom) -> nc2
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc2, aes(fill = SID)) + 
  facet_wrap(~VAR, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(VAR = year_labels)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 34:36) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = sf.colors(20)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white"))
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
year_labels = c("SID74" = "1974 - 1978", "SID79" = "1979 - 1984")
nc.32119 %>% select(SID74, SID79) %>% gather(VAR, SID, -geom) -> nc2
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc2, aes(fill = SID)) + 
  facet_wrap(~VAR, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(VAR = year_labels)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 34:36) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = sf.colors(20)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white"))
```
</details>

An interactive, leaflet-based map is obtained in figure \@ref(fig:mapviewfigure).
```{r mapviewfigure, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mapview))
nc.32119 %>% mapview(zcol = "BIR74", legend = TRUE, col.regions = sf.colors)
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mapview))
nc.32119 %>% mapview(zcol = "BIR74", legend = TRUE, col.regions = sf.colors)
```
</details>

## Coordinate reference systems

In figure \@ref(first-map), the grey lines denote _graticules_,
lines with constant latitude or longitude. Clearly, these lines
are not straight, which indicates that a _projection_ of the data
was used for which the x and y axis do not align with longitude
and latitude. In figure \@ref(fig:mapview) we see that the north
boundary of North Carolina is plotted as a straight line again,
indicating that another projection was used.

The underlying geographical coordinates, depicted by the graticules
of figure \@ref(first-map), are associated with a particular _datum_
(here: NAD27), which implicates a set of rules what the shape of the
Earth is and how it is attached to the Earth (to which point of the
Earth is the origin associated, and how is it directed).  If one
would measure coordinates with a GPS device (e.g. a mobile phone)
it would typically report coordinates associated with the WGS84
datum, and be around 30 m different from the identical coordinates
numbers when associated with NAD27.

Projections describe how we go back and forth between 

* **geographical coordinates** which are expressed as degrees
latitude and longitude, pointing to locations on a shape
approximating the Earth's shape (an ellipsoid or spheroid), and

* **projected coordinates** which are coordinates on a flat,
two-dimensional coordinate system, used when plotting maps.

Datums transformations are associated with moving from one datum
to another.  Both topics are covered by _spatial reference systems_
are described in more detail in chapter \@ref(rs).

## Raster and vector data

Polygon, point and line geometries are examples of _vector_ data:
point coordinates describe the "exact" locations that can be
anywhere. Raster data on the other hand describe data where values
are aligned on a _raster_, meaning on a regularly laid out lattice of
usually square pixels. An example is shown in figure \@ref(fig:ras).

```{r ras,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="raster maps: Landsat-7 blue band, with color values derived from data values (a), the top-left 10x10 sub-image from (a) with numeric values shown (b), and overlayed by two different types of vector data: three sample points (c), and a 500m radius around the points represented as polygons (d)", message=FALSE}
library(stars)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
par(mar = rep(1, 4))
tif <- system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")
x <- read_stars(tif)[,,,1]
image(x, main = "(a)")
image(x[,1:10,1:10], text_values = TRUE, border = 'grey', main = "(b)")
image(x, main = "(c)")
set.seed(131)
pts = st_sample(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(x)), 3)
plot(pts, add = TRUE, pch = 3, col = 'blue')
image(x, main = "(d)")
plot(st_buffer(pts, 500), add = TRUE, pch = 3, border = 'blue', col = NA, lwd = 2)
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(stars)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
par(mar = rep(1, 4))
tif <- system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")
x <- read_stars(tif)[,,,1]
image(x, main = "(a)")
image(x[,1:10,1:10], text_values = TRUE, border = 'grey', main = "(b)")
image(x, main = "(c)")
set.seed(131)
pts = st_sample(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(x)), 3)
plot(pts, add = TRUE, pch = 3, col = 'blue')
image(x, main = "(d)")
plot(st_buffer(pts, 500), add = TRUE, pch = 3, border = 'blue', col = NA, lwd = 2)
```
</details>

Vector and raster data can be combined in different ways; for instance we can query the raster at the three points of figure \@ref(fig:ras)(c), 
```{r raspts,echo=FALSE}
st_extract(x, pts)
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
st_extract(x, pts)
```
</details>
or compute an aggregate, such as the average, over arbitrary regions such as the circles shown in figure \@ref(fig:ras)(d):
```{r rasbuffers,echo=FALSE}
aggregate(x, st_buffer(pts, 500), FUN = mean) %>% st_as_sf()
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
aggregate(x, st_buffer(pts, 500), FUN = mean) %>% st_as_sf()
```
</details>

Other raster-to-vector conversions are discussed in \@ref(raster-to-vector) and include

* converting raster pixels in point values
* converting raster pixels into small polygons, possibly merging polygons with identical values (polygonize)
* generating lines or polygons that delineate continuous pixel areas with a certain value _range_ (contouring)


```{r vectoras,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="The map obtained by rasterizing county total number of births for the period 1974-1979  shown in figure 1.1"}
plot(st_rasterize(nc["BIR74"], dx = 0.1), col =sf.colors(), breaks = "equal")
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(st_rasterize(nc["BIR74"], dx = 0.1), col =sf.colors(), breaks = "equal")
```
</details>

Vector-to-raster conversions can be as simple as rasterizing polygons, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:vectoras). Other, more general vector-to-raster conversions include

* interpolation of point values to points on a regular grid (chapter \@ref(interpolation))
* estimating densities of points over a regular grid (chapter \@ref(pointpatterns))
* area-weighted interpolation of polygon values to grid cells (section \@ref(areaweighted))
* direct rasterization of points, lines or polygons (section @\ref(rasterize))

## Raster types

Raster dimensions describe how the rows and columns relate to
spatial coordinates. Figure \@ref(rastertypes01) shows a number
of different possibilities.

```{r rastertypes01, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="various raster types"}
x = 1:5
y = 1:4
d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c("x", "y"))
m = matrix(runif(20),5,4)
r1 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

r = attr(d, "raster")
r$affine = c(0.2, -0.2)
attr(d, "raster") = r
r2 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

r = attr(d, "raster")
r$affine = c(0.1, -0.3)
attr(d, "raster") = r
r3 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

x = c(1, 2, 3.5, 5, 6)
y = c(1, 1.5, 3, 3.5)
d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c("x", "y"))
r4 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

grd = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(10,10), offset = c(-130,10), n= c(8,5), crs=st_crs(4326))
r5 = st_transform(grd, "+proj=laea +lon_0=-70 +lat_0=35")

par(mfrow = c(2,3), mar = c(0.1, 1, 1.1, 1))
r1 = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(1,1), n = c(5,4), offset = c(0,0))
plot(r1, main = "regular")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r2)), main = "rotated")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r3)), main = "sheared")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r4, as_points = FALSE)), main = "rectilinear")
plot(st_geometry((r5)), main = "curvilinear")
```
<details>
<summary style="color:blue;">Click for Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}

</details>

Regular rasters like shown in figure \@ref(ras) have a constant,
not necessarily square cell size and axes aligned with the x and y
(Easting and Northing) axes. Other raster types include those
where the axes are no longer aligned with x and y (_rotated_),
where axes are no longer perpendicular (_sheared_), or where cell
size varies along a dimension (_rectilinear_). Finally, _curvilinear_
rasters have cellsize and/or direction properties that are no longer
independent from the other raster dimension.

When a raster that is regular in a given projection is projected to
another raster while keeping each raster cells in tact, it changes
shape and may become rectilinear (e.g.  from geographic to Mercator,
as in figure \@ref(fig:mapview)) or curvilinear (e.g. from geographic
to Lambert Conic Conformal, as in figure \@ref(fig:fist-map)). When
reverting this procedure, one can recover the exact original raster.

Creating a new, regular grid in the new projection is called raster
(or image) reprojection or warping (section \@ref(warping)). This
process is lossy, irreversible, and may need to be informed whether
raster cells can be interpolated, averaged or summed, or whether
they denote categorical variables; see also section \@ref(support).

## Time series, arrays, data cubes

A lot of spatial data is not _just_ spatial, but in addition temporal. Just like any observation is associated with an observation location, it is associated with an observation time or period. The dataset on the North Carolina counties shown above contains disease cases counted over two time periods, shown in figure \@ref(fig:firstgather). Although the original dataset has these variables in two different columns, for plotting them these columns had to be stacked first, while repeating the associated geometries - a form called _tidy_ by [@tidy]. When we have longer time series associated with geometries, neither option - distributing time over multiple columns, or stacking columns while repeating geometries - works well, and a more effective way of storing such data would be a matrix, where one dimension refers to time, and the other to space. The natural way for image or raster data is alreay to store them in matrices; time series of rasters then lead to a three-dimensional array. The general term for such data is a (spatiotemporal) **data cube**, where cube refers to arrays with any number of dimensions.  Data cubes can refer to both raster and vector data, examples are given in chapter \@ref(raster). 

## Support {#support}

When we have spatial data with geometries that are not points but
collections of points (multi-points, lines, polygons, pixels),
then the attributes associated with these geometries has one
of several different relationships to them. Attributes can have

* a **constant** value for every point of the geometry 
* a value that is unique to only this geometry, describing its **identity**
* a single value that is an **aggregate**  over all points of the geometry

An example of a constant is land use or bedrock type of a polygon. An
example of an identity is a county name. An example of an aggregate
is the number of births over a given period of time, of a county.

The area with to which an attribute value refers to is called
**support**: aggregate properties have block (or polygon, or line)
support, constant properties have point support (they apply to
every point). Support matters when we manipulate the data. For
instance, figure \@ref(vectoras) was derived from a variable that has
polygon support: the number of births per county. Rasterizing these
values gives pixels with values that are associated to counties.
The result of the rasterization is a meaningless map: the numeric
values ("birth totals") are not associated with the raster cells,
and the county boundaries are lost.  Totals of birth for the
whole state can no longer be recovered from the pixel values.
Ignoring support can easily lead to meaningless results. Chapter
\@ref(featureattributes) discusses this further.

Raster cell values may have point support, e.g. when the cell records
the elevation of the point at the cell centre in a digital elevation
model, or cell support, e.g. when a satellite image pixel gives the
color value averaged over (an area similar to the) pixel. Most file
formats do not provide this information, yet it may be important
to know when aggregating, regridding or warping rasters (section
\@ref{warp}).

## Spatial data science software

Although this book largely uses R and R packages for spatial data
science, a number of these packages use software libraries that were
not developed for R specifically.  As an example, the dependency
of R package `sf` on other R packages and system libraries is shown
in figure \@ref(fig:gdal-fig-nodetails).

```{r gdal-fig-nodetails, out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE,fig.cap = "sf and its dependencies; arrows indicate strong dependency, dashed arrows weak dependency"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf_deps.png")
```

The C or C++ libraries used (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ, liblwgeom, s2geometry,
netcdf, udunits2) are all developed, maintained and used by (spatial) data
science communities that are large and mostly different from the
R community.  By using these libraries, we share how we understand
what we are doing with these other communities. Because R, Python
and Julia provide interactive interfaces to this software, many
users get closer to these libraries than do users of other software
based on these libraries. The first part of this book describes
the concepts implemented in these libraries, and although R is
dominantly used to construct examples, it has relevance to spatial
data science in general.

### GDAL

GDAL (geospatial data abstraction library) can be seen as the
Swiss army knive of spatial data; besides for R it is being
used in Python, QGIS, PostGIS, [and more than 100 other software
projects](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SoftwareUsingGdal).

GDAL is a "library of libraries" -- in order to read all these data
sources it needs a large number of other libraries. It typically
links to over 100 other libraries, each of which provides access to
e.g. a particular data file format, database access, or web service.

Binary R packages distributed by CRAN contain only statically linked
code: CRAN does not want to make any assumptions about presence
of third-party libraries on the host system. As a consequence,
when the `sf` package is installed in binary form from CRAN, it
includes a copy of all the required external libraries as well as
their dependencies, which may amount to 100 Mb.

### PROJ

PROJ is a library for cartographic projections and datum
transformations: it converts spatial coordinates from one coordinate
reference system to another. It comes with a large database of known
projections and access to datum grids (high-precision pre-calculated
values for datum transformations). It aligns with an international
standard for coordinate reference systems [@lott2015geographic].
Chapter \@ref(rs) details more about coordinate systems.

### GEOS and s2geometry

GEOS ("Geometry Engine Open Source") and s2geometry are two libraries
for geometric operations. They are used to find measures (length,
area, distance), and calculate predicates (do two geometries have
any points in common?) or new geometries (which points do these two
geometries have in common?). GEOS does this for flat, two-dimensional
space (indicated by $R^2$), s2geometry does this for geometries on
the sphere (indicated by $S^2$). Chapter \@ref(cs) discusses more
about the differences between working with these two spaces.

### netcdf, udunits2, liblwgeom

NetCDF [@netcdf] refers to a file format as well as a C library
for reading and writing netcdf files. It allows the definition of
arrays of any dimensionality, and is widely used for spatial and
spatiotemporal information, especially in the (climate) modelling
communities. Udunits2 [@R-units,@udunits2] is a database and software
library for units of measurement that allows the conversion of
units, handles derived units, and supports user-defined units. The
liblwgeom "library" is a software component of PostGIS [@postgis]
that contains several routines missing from GDAL or GEOS, including
convenient access to GeographicLib routines [@karney2013algorithms]
that ship with PROJ.

## Exercises
1. What are the differences between raster and vector data?
2. Which components of a map can you list?
3. In your own words, why is the numeric information shown in figure \@ref(fig:vectoras) misleading (or meaningless)?
4. When and where would you expect strong differences when doing geometrical operations on $S^2$, compared to doing them on $R^2$?
